### Nimbus Changelog

### Version 2
The first usable release. You can actually expose this one to the outside
world. In addition, I cleaned up my code, undid some really shitty decisions I
made, and eliminated the need for third-party JavaScript libraries (*cough*
jQuery).

### Version 1
The initial release. Kind of a piece of shit.
